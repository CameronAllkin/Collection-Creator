# Collection Creator

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to have a way to create and store information about your collections, being able to specify exactly what information is captured and how.
Designed to be a quick and easy way of not only cataloging items but searching and filtering them.

## What Can You Do?
There are two main actions you can do; creating collections and creating items.
- Creating collections allows you to design and specify a collection's schema, including what information is captured and what type of information that is. This creates a 'skeleton' for your collection that all items adhere to.
- Creating items allows you to specify specific items within a collection following the collection's schema.
- Within both, you can do various searching, sorting, and filtering to see exactly what you want.

## Requirements
There are no* requirements for using this program.
###### * An internet connection may be required if a URL image is chosen for an item/schema.

## Behind the Scenes
All information created within the program is stored locally to the device and is not shared/sharable to anywhere else.
